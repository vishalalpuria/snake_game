## Snake Game in Python

This is a classic Snake game written in Python using the Pygame library.

**Features:**

* Move the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
* Eat apples to grow the snake and increase score
* Avoid hitting the walls or yourself
* Game Over screen with option to restart

**How to Play:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the `pygame` library using `pip install pygame`.
3. Run the script using `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.

**Code Structure:**

* The code is divided into several functions:
    * `Welcome_Screen`: Displays the welcome message and waits for the user to start the game.
    * `Game_Loop`: Handles the main game loop, including snake movement, apple generation, collision detection, and scorekeeping.
    * `plot_snake`: Draws the snake on the screen.
    * `screen_score`: Displays the current score on the screen.
    * `GameOver_On_Screen`: Displays the game over message and restart option.
    * `gameoverEFFECT`: Plays a sound effect when the game ends (requires adding a sound file named `mario.mp3`).

**Further Improvements:**

* Implement difficulty levels with increasing speed.
* Add visual effects for eating apples and game over.
* Allow users to choose the snake's color.

**Feel free to explore and modify this code as you see fit!**

**Note:**

* This game is designed for educational purposes and may not be optimized for high performance.
